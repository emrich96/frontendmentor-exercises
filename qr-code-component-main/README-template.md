### What I learned

It's been a minute since I've worked with pure HTML and CSS, so this was good practice to get back into it.

I haven't worked with media queries, and I haven't worked with mobile sites before. Good learning opportunity.

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    .container {
        width: 40vw;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Gotta review HTML/CSS again
